# Idea

Our aim was to get information on what is happening on twitter
regarding *#bioinformatics*

To achieve this we followed the next steps:

1. Created a git repo: [RaukR_twitter](https://github.com/jonellevillar/RaukR_twitter)

2. Imported data from twitter API using different criteria.

3. We builted functions for cleaning and graphing data:
[Documentation](https://raukr-twitter.netlify.com/)

4. Created a [shinny app](https://sherriying.shinyapps.io/twitter_shiny/)

# Future directions


- Use subregions for plotting maps

--

- Understand how to include functions that use tidy eval and rlang in shiny

--

- Analyze the trends of tweets and new users over time

--

- Predict how popular #RaukR will be in the following years


---

# Conclusion

- We were amazed daily at what we experienced at RaukR.  

--

- The lectures were inspiring and the instructers generous with their time and energy. 

--

- Stage -> commit -> push is the way to go (plus fetch and merge)

--

- We will never forget our Rauk-mates nor the beauty of Gotland.
