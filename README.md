Twitter: a study of bioinformatics tweets dating from 2008 - 2019.

**Intro**: The first twitter ever to hit the twittersphere was launched on March 21, 2006 by co-founder Jack Dorsey. The following year more than 60,000 tweets alone were sent per day during the South By Southwest (@sxsw) Interactive conference in Austin, Texas. The twitter user base has since expanded, reflecting the desire for enhanced communication; from instant and viral, to social media and imagine branding, as well as professional networking within multiple disciplines. The volume of tweets posted pertaining to bioinformatics may reflect not only increasing engagement by scientists who use the platform, but also the current expansive growth in the field in bioinformatics and computational biology. The motivation of our project therefore, was to look at the historical record of tweets pertaining to bioinformatics and the Bioconductor platform and identify patterns that may reflect developments in these fields.  

**Method**: Twenty (20) users were randomly sampled from 1000 users who tweeted during the last 10 years. We extracted active users by screen name and grouped them by country. A Shiny packaged was created to visually present our findings.  Static density maps of North America and three European countries enabled visualization of the twitter volume.  Our work was performed collaboratively and hosted in the GitHub repository.  Xaranger    

**Results**: 
53860 tweets were observed from 2008-2019, with 25% sent from North America, 33% sent from France, Germany and the UK, 18% from a mix of smaller regions, and 24% sent with the geolocation settings turned off.
